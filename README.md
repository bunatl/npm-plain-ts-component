# Plain test ReactJS component written in TypeScript

## Description
One simple component written for ReactJS in TypeScript and compiled into JS ES6. The reason was to try the concept of uploading ReactJS component on npm with minimal setup (only ReactJS and TS lib). All setting were done manually with no additional scripting. 

## Usage
`import My Component from 'plain-ts-component'`

```
 <MyComponent obj={ "param1" } test={ "param2" } />
```

#### Outputs
Component: Obj param1 and other param param2

## Future plan
In the future, I am considering to write a step-by-step guide on how to publish npm reactJS library components in TypeScript.
